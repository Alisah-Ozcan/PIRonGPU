# PIRonGPU 
PIRonGPU is an innovative library that accelerates data retrieval while preserving user privacy through the implementation of Private Information Retrieval (PIR) technology. By modifying the existing [SealPIR](https://github.com/microsoft/SealPIR) protocol with [HEonGPU](https://github.com/Alisah-Ozcan/HEonGPU/tree/main), PIRonGPU leverages the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs to perform computation-intensive tasks at significantly higher speeds. This approach not only ensures that the clientâ€™s data request remains confidential but also enhances performance in high-demand applications. With its modular and flexible design, PIRonGPU offers a secure and efficient solution for modern data querying needs, making it an ideal tool for applications requiring both privacy and high-performance computing.
